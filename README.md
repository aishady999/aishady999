	‚Ä¢	Integrate targeted ads to drive traffic to your website.
	‚Ä¢	Continuous Improvement via GitHub:
	‚Ä¢	Use GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and CI/CD to ensure each new feature is rigorously tested and deployed.
	‚Ä¢	Solicit user feedback directly through GitHub Issues or integrated feedback forms to further refine the system.

Using GitHub to Advance Your Website
	‚Ä¢	Repository Management:
Host your website‚Äôs code on GitHub so you can track changes, work on feature branches, and maintain a history of improvements.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Development:
Break your code into modular add-ons (such as the landscape design tool or wholesale ordering system). This lets you update parts of your site independently.
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD Pipelines:
Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. This ensures that every update (new feature or bug fix) is safely integrated into your live website.
	‚Ä¢	Documentation and Collaboration:
Maintain a detailed README and additional documentation for each module. Use GitHub Issues to track feature requests and bugs‚Äîthis makes collaboration easier if you ever open your project to external contributors.

Final Thoughts

By following this phased roadmap, you can start by reinforcing your core website and contact capabilities, then gradually introduce advanced interactive features and specialized modules like the DIY landscape design tool. Leveraging GitHub throughout this process not only provides you with a robust version control system but also a platform for continuous improvement, testing, and eventual collaboration.

This approach ensures that your existing website evolves into an interactive, lead-generating platform that serves your customers‚Äô needs‚Äîboth retail and wholesale‚Äîwhile showcasing your commitment to innovation and quality service.
